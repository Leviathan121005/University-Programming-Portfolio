Description: This R package integrates support vector machine (SVM) from machine learning with hypothesis testing from statistics. It follows a structured 
  SVM implementation covering data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation. Functions for Z-test and likelihood ratio test 
  (LRT) are provided to evaluate the model's accuracy with statistical rigor. Additionally, the distribution of data and the type I errors 
  from the hypothesis testing can be visualized to help users understand the tests.

## 1. BinarySVMXHT


Language: R

Description: An R package that integrates support vector machine (SVM) from machine learning with hypothesis testing from statistics. It follows a structured SVM implementation covering data preprocessing, feature     selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation. Functions for Z-test and likelihood ratio test (LRT) are provided to evaluate the model's accuracy with statistical rigor. Additionally, the distribution of       data and the type I errors from the hypothesis testing can be visualized to help users design the model. For guides on how to use the package, please refer to the documentation in `BinarySVMXHT/doc/SVM-and-Hypothesis-Testing.html`. 

How to run:
- Download the `BinaryXSVMHT_0.1.0.tar.gz` in the `BinaryXSVMHT` folder.
- In an R codespace, type `install.packages("path/to/BinaryXSVMHT_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")` in the console.
- Continue typing `library(BinaryXSVMHT)` in the R console to load the functions in the package to your R environment.
